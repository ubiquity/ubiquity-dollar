/**
 * @notice Curve MetaPool interface
 *
 * @notice **What is Curve MetaPool**
 * @notice The pool that consists of 2 tokens: stable coin and 3CRV LP token.
 * For example the pool may contain Ubiquity Dollar and 3CRV LP token.
 * This allows users to trade between Ubiquity Dollar and any of the tokens
 * from the Curve 3Pool (DAI, USDC, USDT). When user adds liquidity to the pool
 * then he is rewarded with MetaPool LP tokens. 1 Dollar3CRV LP token != 1 stable coin token.
 * @notice Add liquidity example:
 * 1. User sends 100 Ubiquity Dollars to the pool
 * 2. User gets 100 Dollar3CRV LP tokens of the pool
 * @notice Remove liquidity example:
 * 1. User sends 100 Dollar3CRV LP tokens to the pool
 * 2. User gets 100 Dollar/DAI/USDC/USDT (may choose any) tokens
