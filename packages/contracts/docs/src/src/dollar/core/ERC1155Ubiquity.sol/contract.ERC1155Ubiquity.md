### pause

Pauses all token transfers

```

### unpause

### safeTransferFrom

Transfers `amount` tokens of token type `id` from `from` to `to`.
Emits a `TransferSingle` event.
Requirements:
- `to` cannot be the zero address.
- If the caller is not `from`, it must have been approved to spend ``from``'s tokens via `setApprovalForAll`.
- `from` must have a balance of tokens of type `id` of at least `amount`.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement `IERC1155Receiver-onERC1155Received` and return the
acceptance magic value.


```solidity
function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 id, uint256 amount, bytes memory data)
    public
    virtual
    override;
```

### safeBatchTransferFrom

Batched version of `safeTransferFrom()`
Emits a `TransferBatch` event.
Requirements:
- `ids` and `amounts` must have the same length.
- If `to` refers to a smart contract, it must implement `IERC1155Receiver-onERC1155BatchReceived` and return the
acceptance magic value.


```solidity
function safeBatchTransferFrom(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) public virtual override;
```

### holderTokens

Returns array of token ids held by the `holder`


```solidity
function holderTokens(address holder) public view returns (uint256[] memory);
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`holder`|`address`|Account to check tokens for|

**Returns**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`<none>`|`uint256[]`|Array of tokens which `holder` has|


### _burn

Destroys `amount` tokens of token type `id` from `account`
Emits a `TransferSingle` event.
Requirements:
- `account` cannot be the zero address.
- `account` must have at least `amount` tokens of token type `id`.


```solidity
function _burn(address account, uint256 id, uint256 amount) internal virtual override whenNotPaused;
```

### _burnBatch

Batched version of `_burn()`
Emits a `TransferBatch` event.
Requirements:
- `ids` and `amounts` must have the same length.


```solidity
function _burnBatch(address account, uint256[] memory ids, uint256[] memory amounts)
    internal
    virtual
    override
    whenNotPaused;
```

### _beforeTokenTransfer

Hook that is called before any token transfer. This includes minting
and burning, as well as batched variants.
The same hook is called on both single and batched variants. For single
transfers, the length of the `ids` and `amounts` arrays will be 1.
Calling conditions (for each `id` and `amount` pair):
- When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens
of token type `id` will be  transferred to `to`.
- When `from` is zero, `amount` tokens of token type `id` will be minted
for `to`.
- when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens of token type `id`
will be burned.
- `from` and `to` are never both zero.
- `ids` and `amounts` have the same, non-zero length.


```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(
    address operator,
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256[] memory ids,
    uint256[] memory amounts,
    bytes memory data
) internal virtual override(ERC1155PausableUpgradeable, ERC1155Upgradeable);
```

### _authorizeUpgrade

Allows an admin to upgrade to another implementation contract


```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal virtual override onlyAdmin;
```
**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|----|----|-----------|
|`newImplementation`|`address`|Address of the new implementation contract|
